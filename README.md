## Description

This JavaScript-based side-scroll game with components was created by following the tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org and frankslaboratory.co.uk found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFO_txvwK_c. This projects was a way for me to gain exposure to the process of creating simple games using HTML, CSS, and JS only, as well as gain more practice utilizing JS skills and techniques. This is just a preliminary example of game creation that I will use to continue to grow my game design skills.


## Usage

Pressing the arrow keys will allow the character "Shadowdog" to move around the play area or stop movement. Pressing spacebar will have Shadowdog enter a rolling state that can defeat enemies upon contact. Each enemy defeated adds to the score. When Shadowdog contacts an enemy while not in rolling state he gets dazed which pauses movement briefly and removes a life. The goal is to reach a certain number of enemy defeats within the time limit without losing all lives.
